All explanations for assignments 1 and 2 are in the comments. I have added testng.xml file so the tests can run together.

Locations of the assignments:
Assignment 1: user.dir/src/test/java/assignments
Assignment 2: user.dir/src/test/java/assignments
Assignment 3: user.dir/src/test/assignmentsPostman
Assignment 4: user.dir/src/test/assignmentsPostman

Locations of the reports:
user.dir/src/reports

Explanation for assignment 3:
I have tested all endpoints with multiple test cases. I have created my test cases with logical thinking, because documentation is not complete.

Explanation of assignment 4:
I didn't understand this assignment very well, so I used the imagination. I realized that it is a cookie that should be unset. So, I added cookie with this value to the collection and I set up the expiration date to unset it.
